* Array Data Structure
** What is it?
	 - contingous memory space
	 - needs to have a /specific/ type associated with it
** How does insertion work?
	 - go to address + width * offset (constant time)
	 - don't insert, but overwrite (no allocation)
	 - don't delete, but set to zero or sentinal value (no deallocation)
** Key Takeaways
	 - They are fixed size, contingous memory chunks
	 -- which means you cannot grow it (only reallocate into new array)
	 -- there is no "insertAt" or push/pop
